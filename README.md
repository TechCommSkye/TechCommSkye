## More About Me - A Casual Summary

I'm a tech writer with 5 years of experience wanting to move into the tech sector/software documentation.

Life interrupted my computer systems engineering study halfway through my junior year. Once I was able to return to school, too much time had passed for me to jump back in where I left off. A technical communication degree seemed a reasonable compromise given my situation and interests.

After years of plugging away on MS Word and juggling a half-dozen Adobe CC apps, I'm taking the initiative to build the skills I'm interested in and pursue my goals.

If you're open to allowing me to ply my trade (albeit possibly clumsily at first) on one of your projects, please do reach out.

**Using My Coursework Files as Practice**
_Although not required by the lessons I'm taking, I'm adding the files I create to GitHub via the command line. I'll also include Markdown when appropriate rather than creating documentation with Word, etc._
